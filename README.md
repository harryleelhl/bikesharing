## Summary

The Bike Sharing analysis shows activities of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019, It indicates a high use of bike sharing by subscribed users. The hour for high demand of bike users is betwen 7am and 9am to then the highest bikes used, between 5pm and 7pm. The days for high demand of bike users are between Tuesday and Thursday, with Thursday being the highest in bike usage. This analysis also indicates there is a grand difference between genders for bike sharing. 

Two additional visualizations  suggested for future analysis: 
- We could obtain a complete and detailed type of users (subscribed and non-subscribed) with reason for rides
- Could include the bike sharing info from other bike sharing companies to see citi bikes' strength and weakness or the whole situation in the industry.
